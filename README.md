A modified version of the original Snake game made for the Raspberry PI 4. This version of the classic Snake game is coded directly on the hardware, bypassing the operating system to achieve smooth performance and direct hardware control.

<u>**Usage**</u>

Power up your Raspberry Pi 4 with the game binary loaded. The game should start automatically. Use the connected buttons or keyboard to control the snake. Requires a SNES controller connected to your RPI 4 to play.
